# FizzBuzz <br>
FizzBuzz is a programming challenge where a script must:
- output "Fizz" if a number is divisible by 3
- output "Buzz" if a number is divisible by 5
- output "FizzBuzz" if a number is divisible by 3 and 5

Normally this script will calculate the above conditionals up to a predefinied number, typically 100. I added a twist to this challenge that allows it to calculate the conditionals to any number!
